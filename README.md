# CuraEngine Only Fans plugin

This plugin will filter out all GCode commands except those related to fans (M106, M107, M123, M710)


> Note: Most of the source files have been copied from https://github.com/Ultimaker/CuraEngine_plugin_gradual_flow these
> are currently without a license. Since I'm part of the Cura Team working for UltiMaker I know what the license will be
> on these files, having worked on most of them; but I also have very little patience and I wanted to write the first
> community CuraEngine Plugin, since I'm a huge **FAN**.
> As soon as the license have been updated from the UltiMaker repositories I will reflect the changes in this repo.
